## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time. This allows developers to review changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate effectively on projects.
#### Key Concepts:
1) Repository: A central location where all project files and their history are stored.
2) Commit: A snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time.
3) Branch: A parallel version of the project, allowing developers to work on different features or bug fixes independently.
4) Merge: Combining changes from different branches into a single branch.

#### Why GitHub is Popular:
1) Cloud-based: No need for local servers to manage version control.
2) Collaboration: GitHub facilitates teamwork by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
3) Features: It offers features like pull requests, issues, and wikis for project management and communication.
4) Community: A large and active community of developers provides support and resources.

#### How Version Control Maintains Project Integrity:
1) Tracking Changes: Every change to the code is recorded, making it easy to identify the source of errors or bugs.
2) Reverting Changes: If a mistake is made, developers can easily revert to a previous working version.
3) Collaboration: Version control ensures that multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
4) Backup: It acts as a backup for the project, preventing data loss.
5) History: It provides a complete history of the project, which can be valuable for auditing and understanding the evolution of the code.
